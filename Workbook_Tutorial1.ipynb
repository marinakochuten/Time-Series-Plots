You can use this as a space to create your own workflow, based on the steps in the tutorial. We suggest using the same data file mentioned in the tutorial, but:\n",

    "\n",
    "Once you've found the file path, the next step is to use the imported package Xarray to open the data set. Weâ€™ll use the `open_dataset()` function from xarray to open the NetCDF file. This will be referred to using the syntax `xr.open_dataset()`, where `xr` is the \"alias\" you gave the xarray package when it was imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "All you need to do is to copy the terminal code that revealed the location of the file in your computer and paste it into the `xr.open_dataset()` function. This function then reads the file and loads it into an xarray.Dataset object which allows for easy manipulation and analysis of the data."
